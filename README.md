# IRCBot 2.0 - IRCBot harder
## To use bot commands, just type '!<command>', '<bot name> <command>' or '<bot name>, <command>'
	For example:
	* xTouchMe: !say test
	* xTouchMeBot: test
	* xTouchMe: xTouchMeBot action dances
	* xTouchMeBot dances
	* xTouchMe: xTouchMeBot, slap everyone
	* xTouchMe steals everyone's cookies. Mwahahahaha!
	
* Will be creating a wiki entry for the bot's commands

### In order to compile and run the bot, you'll need 'JSPF' and 'PircBot'

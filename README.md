# IRCBot 2.0 - IRCBot harder

To use bot commands, just type '!<command>', '<bot name> <command>' or '<bot name>, <command>'
	
	For example:
		xTouchMe: !say test
		xTouchMeBot: test
		xTouchMe: xTouchMeBot action dances
		xTouchMeBot dances
		xTouchMe: xTouchMeBot, slap everyone
		xTouchMeBot steals everyone's cookies. Mwahahahaha!
	
* Will be creating a wiki entry for the bot's commands

#### In order to compile the bot for you own usage, you'll need both '[JSPF](http://code.google.com/p/jspf/)' and '[PircBot](http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php)' java libraries
